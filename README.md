## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Proud of myself for this one. The most complex code I've written for a project thus far. Approached the solution like a programmer, and independently created and interconnected the various functions and addEventListeners.  

### Continued development

More practice; continuously and consistently!
